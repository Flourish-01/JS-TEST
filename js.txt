                                    section B
1. a. '*- multiplication' it is used to perform  multiplication  operation on number data type
      '+ - addition' it can be used to perform addition operation or concertination of strings
      '- subtraction' it is used to perform subtraction operation on number data type
      '= assignment operator' it is used to assign the value on the write hand side to be equals the value on the left hand side 
      '/ - division operator' it is used to perform division operation on number data type
      '% - modulus operator' it is used to perform division operation on number data type and give the remainder
      '=== strict assignment operator' it  checks if the value is strictly the same in value and data type
      '** - raised to power ' it raises the integer to the power of something; (2**3 means 2 raised to  the power of 3)
      '< -less than' it checks if the value on the left and side is less than the value on the right and side
      '<= -less than or equal to ' it checks if the value on the left and side is less than or equal to the value on the right and side

       '> -greater than' it checks if the value on the left and side is greater than the value on the right and side
      '>= -greater than or equal to ' it checks if the value on the left and side is greater than or equal to the value on the right and side 
      '== -double assignment operator ' - it checks if the value Right hand side = To value on the Left amd side 
      ''
      


2. Tenary operators usually have 3 operands eg the if else statement
if(condition to be met ){
    what happens when condition is met
} else{
    what happens when the condition is not met
} 

it can be written this way: condition to be met? what happens when condition is met: what happens when the condition is not met
